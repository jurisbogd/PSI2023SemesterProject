# PSI2023SemesterProject

Programų sistemų bakalauro 3 semestro projektas programų sistemų inžinerijos dalykui.

## Program idea
Make the program that contains packages of flash cards.
You can access every card one by one. There is a couple types of the cards: 
- Test type cards
- Open answer type cards

---
### Test type cards
You get one card and have to pick an answer from a to c. If you get it right, this card will disappear, if you did not get it right, this card will go back to the deck.

---
### Open answer type cards
Idea is the same as with **test type cards** just you will not get the answers from a to c. You can answer the question in your mind and see the answer after on the screen.

---
### More functionality
We can also add more functionality to this program.
- Everyone can create their own flash cards.
- If you did not get the answer right or you do not feel like you know it well, you can mark that card down and come back to it after.
